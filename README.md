# Rust-Decouple

Rust decouple is a long term project that aims to mimic the functionality of the [python-decouple](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/) library

Due to the nature of the Rust language, the library will be implemented in a different way, but the goal is to provide a similar functionality. So far, the library is in a very early stage of development and is not ready for use.

The benefits of the rust version is that the cast is automatically done by the library, so you don't have to worry about it.
